// This file is the entry point for client-side rendering in a Remix application.
// It uses React's `hydrateRoot` to attach the React application to the server-rendered HTML.
// The `StrictMode` wrapper is used to help identify potential problems in the application.
// The `startTransition` function is used to mark the hydration as a low-priority update, allowing the browser to remain responsive during the process.
// This setup is essential for enabling client-side navigation and interactivity in a Remix app.
// This file is automatically generated by Remix and should not be modified directly.
// It is used to bootstrap the client-side application after the server has rendered the initial HTML.
// The `RemixBrowser` component is the root component for the Remix application, which handles routing and rendering of pages.
